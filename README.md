# Okta-Python-scripts

<b> Note: </b> <br>
:warning: Once those will be modified and made Python 3.x compliant - this will NOT be an official Okta Dev-vetted product / script anymore, but rather a personal project. This does not qualify for any Okta support. Anyone who chooses to use this must ensure that their implementation meets any applicable legal obligations including any Okta terms and conditions. :warning:

<b> Special thanks to Sohaib Ajmal from the Okta Developer Support team who provided the foundation for these scripts - having them written in Python 2.x in their initial form. </b>
